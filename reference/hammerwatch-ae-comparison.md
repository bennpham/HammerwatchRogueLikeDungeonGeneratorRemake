# Hammerwatch vs Anniversary Edition — player balance

How the original game's player tweak values (`src/generator/tweak/baseline.ts`,
transcribed from the stock `tweak/*.xml`) compare with **Hammerwatch
Anniversary Edition (AE)**. Compiled 2026-10-08 from AE's unpacked assets
(`Hammerwatch Anniversary Edition/unpacked_assets_66/players/`: `classes.sval`
and `<class>/skills/*.sval`, plus `tweak/buffs/buffs.sval` and
`scripts/GUI/Shop/PowerShopMenuContent.as`). This is the source for the
**Anniversary Edition** player preset (`src/generator/tweak/presets.ts`).

AE runs on a newer engine with its own `.sval` data, so most values had to be
matched by meaning rather than by key. AE's paladin is the original's knight.

## Reading AE's numbers

- **Units.** AE uses milliseconds where the original uses seconds, and pixels
  where it uses tiles (16 px per tile). Mana and health regen are per second
  in AE and **ms per point** in the original (`1000 / AE value`). Percent
  chances (bash, crit, dodge, kill-heal, frost shield, chill) are 0–1 in AE and
  0–100 in the original. The thief's `knives-speed-mod` is `AE move-speed-mul − 1`.
  The priest's `smite-speed-pen` is `(1 − AE mul) × 100`.
- **Tier nesting.** A shop ladder's first tier is usually a `modifier-skills`
  entry, and later tiers are its nested `upgrades`. For health, mana, armor and
  a few skills, the first tier is the skill's own top-level `cost`.
- **Damage scale.** Enemy HP is the same in both games (tick 16; bats
  3/5/35), so an AE damage number means the same thing in the original. AE's
  fireball has no separate splash damage: one `Explode` deals `proj-damage`
  to everything inside `proj-radius`.
- **Tier counts.** Every ladder has the same number of tiers in both games.

## What differs (copied into the preset)

| Unit | Original → AE |
|---|---|
| shared | `move-speed` 0.9 → AE ranged 1.0 / melee 1.2 (shop 1.1–1.3 / 1.3–1.5). The original has one shared key, so the preset uses **1.1** (shop 1.2/1.3/1.4). `combo-timer` 0.75 → 1.0, tiers 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2 → 1.25/1.5/1.75/2/2.25 s. `pot-dmg` cost 300 → 1000 |
| knight | `sword-dmg` 9 → 13, tiers 14/20/26/32/38 → 20/26/33/40/46. Costs: dmg1 800 → 600, arc1 250 → 200, health-2..5 1200/1800/2400/3000 → 1000/2200/2900/3600. Armor tiers 4/5: 9/10 → 10/12. Mana regen tiers 2–5: 900/800/700/600 → 909/833/769/714 ms (AE 1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4 per s) |
| thief | knives-dmg tiers 1–3: 8/12/16 → 7/11/15. Costs: dmg1 800 → 700, aspeed1 250 → 150 |
| wizard | `fireball-dmg` 10 → 16, tiers 14/18/22/25/28 → 21/26/30/35/40. Costs: dmg1 800 → 650, rng1 500 → 400, health-2 1500 → 1000 |
| sorcerer | Costs: dmg1 800 → 700, rng1 500 → 450, health-2 1500 → 1000 |
| priest | Costs: dmg1 600 → 500, sspeed1 250 → 150 |
| ranger | Costs: dmg1 800 → 700, pen1 700 → 550, armor-3/4 2000/2700 → 1800/2400 |
| warlock | Costs: dmg1 800 → 700, dmg4/5 3800/4800 → 3900/5200, poison1 250 → 200. `lightning-mana-cost` 25 → 20, tiers 28/31/34/37 → 23/26/29/32 |

Everything else in the nine class files matches, either exactly or after unit
conversion within a rounding step. That includes base health, mana and regen,
every other price, meteor, nova, comet, ice orb, chill, beam, draining field,
cripple aura, bow, bomb, flurry, crit, dodge, growth, poison, storm, kill
mana/heal and the gargoyle's stats.

## Differs, but not copied

- **Built differently in AE, so the numbers aren't comparable:**
  - **Wizard flame spray:** AE fires 2 piercing projectiles every 150 ms (damage 4…18, mana 2…4).
  - **Ranges and projectile speeds:** fireball range, shard bounce, comet drop distance, smite range, bow projectile speed, thief chain speed.
  - **Knight:** charge distance and speed (AE uses `20x+10` px and `2x+3`), sword and whirl reach.
  - **Warlock lightning:** AE adds a flat 10-damage orb hit and a 0.75× falloff per bounce.
  - **Warlock gargoyle:** AE fires a fan of 3 projectiles every 250 ms.
- **Only changeable by editing a buff file:** the thief smoke stun is 5000 ms in the original and 2000 ms in AE.
- **AE data that contradicts AE's own description text (the original value is kept):**
  - knight whirl-dur tier 2: AE's data says 6000 ms, its text says 8 s;
  - priest smite-speed tier 5: data 0.4, text 40;
  - priest mana-regen tier 5: data 4, text 3.5;
  - `priest_mana_shield.sval` holds two versions of the skill, one with 4 tiers and one with 5.

## AE-only (no original tweak key)

- **Moving while casting:** each AE skill carries `move-speed-mul` plus a time window and an `anim-walk`. For example, the wizard walks at 0.33× speed during meteor. The original's casting movement is engine code with no tweak key.
- **Cooldowns and cast points** on every skill.
- **Skills and shop items:**
  - thief acrobatics (a free evade stack every 6 s);
  - the speed potion (300g);
  - frost shield's slow and `physical-based`;
  - fire shield's combo on hit;
  - fire nova's fixed 3 damage per flame;
  - storm's cooldown, tied to its duration.
- **Ranger bow:** heat (overheating and recovery) and arrow lifetime.
- **Thief:** no gold cost per cast for fan, smoke or chain. Buying the skill unlocks it.

## Enemy difficulty (`general.xml`) — not a player setting

AE has no `general.xml` equivalent. It has four difficulties set by compile-time
flags. The only global scalar is `Tweak::EnemyHealthMul` (`scripts/Data/Misc.as`):
0.66 / 1.0 / 1.25 / 1.5, against the original's `EnemyHealthAll` of 0.75 / 1 / 1.1.
Enemy damage and speed are set per enemy (`%if DIFF_*` blocks in 135
`actors/` files). A player preset leaves all of this alone.
