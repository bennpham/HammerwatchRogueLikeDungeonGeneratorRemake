/**
 * Scatter placement for boss-wave monsters on a non-anchor spawn mode
 * (issue #21). Where `anchors` trickles a monster's budget out of the 9 fixed
 * points on a timer, a scatter mode spreads its own points across the arena —
 * so this module's job is to turn "40 bats, gaussian" into concrete interior
 * tiles.
 *
 * How many tiles is `request.points`, not `request.count`: up to the arena's
 * `spawn.batchSize` a monster still gets a point each and the whole group fires
 * at once, but a bigger count is spread over `batchSize` points and trickled in
 * by waves.ts on a timer. 480 actors materialising on one frame is what made the
 * stock Castle arena unplayable (playtest 2026-08-27).
 *
 * It is the sibling of cover.ts and deliberately mirrors it: the same four
 * pattern names, the same `ctx.bossRand`-only rule, the same bounded attempt
 * loops, and (nearly) the same rejection filter (`cover.ts`'s exported
 * `isFree`), so a spawn point can never land on the boss, the entrance, the
 * alcove, one of the 9 anchors, a cover pillar, or another spawn point. The
 * shared geometry helpers live in placement.ts.
 *
 * On top of that filter a spawn point must sit on floor the player can actually
 * reach (`cover.ts`'s `reachableMask`). The connectivity prune only guarantees
 * the boss, the anchors and the alcove stay connected — a pocket sealed off
 * behind pillars is a legal pillar layout and an illegal place for a monster.
 *
 * The one deliberate difference from cover.ts: a spawn point also has to clear
 * the north wall band (`isFreeSpawn` below). A pillar in the top rows is
 * decoration; a *monster* there is the #22 bug, and cover.ts has no reason to
 * care.
 *
 * Two things it does that cover.ts does not:
 *
 *   1. **The count is a promise, not a budget.** Cover skips a pillar it
 *      cannot fit; a wave's monster count is something the user typed, so when
 *      the floor runs out the leftovers land on other reachable floor, then on
 *      the points that *were* placed, and only then on the 9 anchors. See
 *      `padToCount`. The requested count is always the count that spawns.
 *   2. **It runs last.** `arena.ts` calls it after `placeCoverPillars` and
 *      `placeFood`, so every draw it makes is appended to the end of the
 *      `ctx.bossRand` stream. With no scatter monster in any wave there are no
 *      requests and therefore no draws at all, which is what keeps every arena
 *      generated before this feature byte-identical.

 * somewhere. In preference order:
 *
 *   1. **Real, reachable floor** the pattern did not use, strided so the pad
 *    points spread across the arena instead of bunching into one corner.
 *    Deterministic (row-major order, fixed stride) — no `ctx.bossRand` draw, so

 *   2. **The points already placed**, round-robin — two monsters on one tile is
 *    a far smaller problem than a horde silently shrinking.
 *   3. **The 9 spawn anchors**, the historical fallback, for a pathological
 *    arena with no reachable floor left at all.
 *
 * Order 1 before 2 is the fix for the 2026-08-27 playtest report that `random`
 * "only places things on the corners and NWES": the old version went straight to
 * the anchors whenever a pattern placed *nothing*, and a saturated arena made
 * that the common case rather than the pathological one. The anchors are still
 * the last resort, so the guarantee that a count always spawns is unchanged.
 *
 * No north-band check is needed on any source: `anchors()` puts N/NE/NW at
 * `NORTH_ANCHOR_INSET` or deeper, the placed points cleared the band already,
 * and the reachable-tile source is filtered for it below.
