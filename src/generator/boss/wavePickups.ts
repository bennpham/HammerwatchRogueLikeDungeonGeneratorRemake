/**
 * Item drops per boss wave tier — the loot half of the wave rig.
 *
 * Each of the five tiers (100 / 75 / 50 / 25% and Boss Died) may carry any
 * number of drop rows, each naming an item from PICKUP_DEFS and how many copies
 * of it land. When the tier's threshold fires, the copies appear on the
 * entrance drop pad (boss/pickupPad.ts) and stay on the floor until somebody
 * walks over them.
 *
 *   tier 0 (100%)   AreaTrigger -> entranceShape
 *                        └─ SpawnObject{trigger-times: 1} × copies
 *
 *   tier N          GlobalEventTrigger(TIER_EVENT_NAMES[N - 1])
 *                        └─ SpawnObject{trigger-times: 1} × copies
 *
 * Three things separate this from waveBuffs.ts, which it is otherwise modelled
 * on:
 *
 * 1. **Tiers do not replace one another.** A buff field is a live effect, so a
 *    tier switches the previous tier's set off as it switches its own on. An
 *    item is an object on the floor — there is nothing to switch off, and the
 *    50% health the party did not collect is still there at 25%. So no
 *    ToggleElement chain at all.
 *
 * 2. **A count is copies, not `trigger-times`.** A SpawnObject spawns ONE actor
 *    per incoming trigger, and a tier trigger fires once, so `trigger-times: 4`
 *    on one node would drop one item and bank three. Four copies means four
 *    nodes. `trigger-times: 1` is still what each node carries, and it matters:
 *    tier 0's AreaTrigger re-fires every time a player walks back over the
 *    entrance, and without the bound the 100% drop would be an infinite item
 *    fountain.
 *
 * 3. **It builds its own tier trigger** rather than sharing waves.ts's. A tier
 *    with drops but no monsters is legal, and waves.ts skips a monsterless tier
 *    entirely.
 *
 * Placement is the drop pad, not the nine spawn anchors. The anchors were the
 * first attempt and were wrong: they are chosen to be far apart so a horde
 * surrounds the party, which turned a mid-fight heal into a cross-arena run
 * through the wave that had just spawned on the same tile (playtest
 * 2026-08-28 — the 50% health and the 25% potion were never found). Every drop
 * now lands in one learnable place just inside the entrance, sorted into a
 * lane by item kind.
 *
 * One cursor per lane, carried across every tier rather than reset per tier, so
 * the 50% drops and the boss-death drops fill a column side by side instead of
 * landing on the same tile. A slot with a cover pillar on it is skipped for the
 * lane's next slot; the mask is read, never written, so cover placement is
 * unaffected and no ctx.bossRand draw moves.
 *
 * Like waves.ts, waveBuffs.ts and invulnerability.ts this module draws **no**
 * random values from any stream — not from `ctx.bossRand` either — and writes
 * no XML directly. It is built last, so switching it on only ever appends ids
 * and no existing arena seed moves.
