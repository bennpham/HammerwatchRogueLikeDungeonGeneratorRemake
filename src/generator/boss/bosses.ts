 * The seven end-boss actors and their real footprints.
 *
 * Footprints are measured from each actor's own `<collision>` shape in
 * `editor/assetsExtract/actors/boss_<name>/boss_<name>.xml` on a real
 * Hammerwatch install (verified 2026-08-08, `DISCOVERY-LOG.md`), converted
 * from pixels to tiles at the game's fixed 16px/tile scale:
 *
 * - anubis, krilith carry no `<collision>` child at all — the actor falls
 *   back to the radius on the `<actor collision="N">` attribute itself
 *   (anubis 7px, krilith 3.5px), so footprint = that radius doubled / 16.
 * - dragon, knight, lich, worm each have `<collision><circle radius="R" .../>`
 *   — footprint = 2R / 16 (a circle, so width == height).
 * - queen has two `<polygon>` children with no single circle; footprint is the
 *   axis-aligned bounding box of every `<point>` in both polygons, in tiles:
 *   x spans -43..38 (81px = 5.0625 tiles), y spans -33..50 (83px = 5.1875
 *   tiles). This is the largest footprint of the seven and is what
 *   `geometry.ts`'s `BOSS_FOOTPRINT_AREA` reserves against.
 *
 * `boss_dragon` has no upward-facing art (its 9-slot aim arc and every walk
 * frame face down/down-diagonal) and `<collision static="true">` — it cannot
 * move, so it goes against the top wall. `boss_queen` is also `static="true"`
 * with no `movement` dict at all, but its skill list attacks in every
 * direction, so centre is correct for it same as the movers.
 *
 * A wall-placed boss also needs its collision `offset`, not just its footprint.
 * The dragon's is `<circle offset="0 -8" radius="34" />`: the collider centre
 * sits half a tile ABOVE the actor position and reaches 2.125 tiles out, so an
 * actor flush against the top wall carries 2.625 tiles of *static* collider
 * into the wall band. [VERIFIED] in game (DISCOVERY-LOG.md, 2026-08-16): at
 * interior row 0 the dragon was unreachable, unhittable and could not fire —
 * it read as being off the map to the north. `topWallBossY` below derives the
 * shallowest row whose collider clears the band; for the dragon that is row 3,
 * which is the hand-patched arena the fix was confirmed on.
