/**
 * Buffs per boss wave tier — an arena-wide buff field per health threshold.
 *
 * Each of the five tiers (100 / 75 / 50 / 25% and Boss Died) may carry any
 * number of buffs, each aimed at players, monsters or both, and each getting
 * its own field. Unlike the wave *spawns*, which switch on and never off so
 * that by 25% all four tiers are running at once, the buffs **replace** one
 * another: a tier's trigger switches the previous tier's whole set off as it
 * switches its own on, so only one tier's buffs are ever active. That is what
 * makes the fight read as phases rather than as an accumulating pile of
 * debuffs.
 *
 *   tier 0 (100%)   DangerArea{enabled: True, damage: 0, buff} -> shape
 *                   (live from arena load — no trigger, it IS the opening state)
 *
 *   tier N          GlobalEventTrigger(TIER_EVENT_NAMES[N - 1])
 *                        ├─ ToggleElement{state: 1} -> each previous tier field
 *                        └─ ToggleElement{state: 0} -> each of this tier's
 *
 * `state: 0` ENABLES and `state: 1` disables — the inverted polarity
 * NodeToggleElement documents and prefabs/trap_fire_floor.xml confirms.
 *
 * "The previous tier's field" is the nearest EARLIER tier that actually carries
 * a buff, not `tier - 1`: a campaign that buffs only 100% and 25% must have the
 * 25% trigger switch off the 100% field, and there is no tier-2 field to name.
 *
 * Like waves.ts and invulnerability.ts this module draws **no** random values
 * from any stream — not from `ctx.bossRand` either — and writes no XML
 * directly. It is built after both of those, so switching it on only ever
 * appends ids and no existing arena seed moves.
