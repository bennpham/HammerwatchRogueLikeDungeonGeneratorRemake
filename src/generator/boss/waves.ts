/**
 * The boss arena's wave spawn rig (boss-tab.md §4 "Wave wiring"). Pure
 * script-node wiring — no RNG, no XML written directly (every node type used
 * here already exists in objects/nodes.ts and self-registers on
 * `ctx.scriptNodes` via ScriptNode's constructor).
 *
 * Shape, repeated once per tier (100% / 75% / 50% / 25%):
 *
 *   trigger ─> ToggleElement{state: 0} ─> TimerTrigger(enabled=False)
 *                                              │
 *                                              v
 *                                   SpawnObject × (monster, anchor)
 *
 * Tier 0 (100%) is triggered by an AreaTrigger over the arena's entrance
 * shape; tiers 1-3 (75/50/25%) are triggered by a GlobalEventTrigger the
 * engine fires at that health threshold. A tier with two distinct spawn
 * intervals gets two independent ToggleElement -> TimerTrigger chains, both
 * fed by the same tier trigger — NodeToggleElement can only enable a single
 * downstream element (`element` is one id, not an array), so "one toggle per
 * timer" is the only way to switch on more than one timer per tier.
 *
 * Nothing ever disables a timer: once a tier's trigger fires, its timers run
 * until their SpawnObject budgets are exhausted, and lower tiers keep firing
 * as health drops further, so at 25% health all four tiers are spawning at
 * once (boss-tab.md, boss-tab-handoff.md item 6).
 *
 * A monster on a *scatter* spawn mode (issue #21) skips that whole rig: it
 * gets no toggle and no timer, and its SpawnObjects — one per monster, at
 * points spawnPoints.ts placed across the arena, each with `trigger-times: 1`
 * — hang directly off the tier trigger, so the entire group appears the moment
 * the tier fires:
 *
 *   trigger ─> SpawnObject{trigger-times: 1} × count
 *
 * A tier whose monsters are all on scatter modes therefore emits no
 * ToggleElement or TimerTrigger at all.
 *
 * A pool entry is a monster VARIANT key, not a bare monster id — `bat1` is the
 * ordinary bat, `bat1#0` the bats spawner, `archer1#2` the elite archer (see
 * monsterTypes.ts). `resolveActorPath` turns the key into one actor path with
 * no RNG draw: the wave rig is deterministic structure, not a roll, so a key
 * always resolves to the same actor. That is the whole difference from the
 * dungeon, which rolls tiers upward with `upgradeChance` in Monster.createRolled
 * and picks spawners separately in room.ts.
 *
 * This module draws no RNG at all, including for the scatter modes: the points
 * are placed by arena.ts (which owns the ctx.bossRand draw order) and passed in
 * as a finished map.

/**

 * — enforced by validation.ts, not re-checked here) and wires every timed
 * SpawnObject onto `anchorList` (the 9 fixed-order anchors from anchors.ts).
 *
 * `entranceShape` is the arena's entrance RectangleShape, built and
 * positioned by the caller (Phase 5e's arena.ts) — this module only connects
 * an AreaTrigger to it, it never places or sizes arena geometry.
 *
 * `spawnPoints` carries the scattered monsters' placed points, keyed by
 * `spawnPointKey(tier, monsterKey)` — `scatterRequests` decides what goes in
 * it and arena.ts fills it. Defaulting it to an empty map is what lets a
 * caller that has no scatter modes (and every test written before them) call
 * this with five arguments: a scattered monster with no points is simply not
 * wired.
 *
 * A tier with an empty monster pool (`wave.monsters.length === 0`, allowed —
 * validation only warns) degrades safely: no trigger, toggle or timer is
 * created for it at all, so no node ever ships with an empty `connections`
 * array. Node positions here are cosmetic (editor-only markers; the actual
 * trigger geometry is the entrance shape and the SpawnObject anchors) so they
 * just walk down from the entrance shape's position, one row per node.
