/**
 * The drop pad: where a wave tier's items land.
 *
 * Wave pickups used to be dealt round-robin onto the nine spawn anchors, which
 * put a mid-fight heal on a wall midpoint 25 tiles away, behind the horde that
 * had just spawned on the same tile. The anchors exist to make a horde
 * *surround* the party — deliberately far apart, hugging the walls — and that
 * is exactly wrong for a resupply the party has to walk to. The 2026-08-28
 * playtest found the 50% health and the 25% potion had both been dealt to the
 * north wall and never been found at all.
 *
 * So drops go to a fixed pad just inside the entrance instead: one place, the
 * place the party already spawns at and retreats to, laid out the same way on
 * every seed so it can be learnt once.
 *
 * The layout, with `cx` the entrance's centre column and `padY` two rows north
 * of the entrance mouth (`.` is untouched floor):
 *
 *        cx-4  cx-3 cx-2  cx-1   cx   cx+1 cx+2  cx+3
 *   ...    H    (h)    .     U     U     .   (m)    M     padY - 4
 *          H    (h)    .     U     U     .   (m)    M     padY - 3
 *          H    (h)    .     U     U     .   (m)    M     padY - 2
 *          H    (h)    .     U     U     .   (m)    M     padY - 1
 *          P     P     P     P     P     P    P     P     padY
 *          p     p     p     p     p     p    p     p     padY + 1
 *                          [ the entrance mouth ]        padY + 2
 *
 * Health runs up the left, mana up the right, the eight upgrades fill the
 * two-wide block in the middle, and the potions sit in the bottom row, nearest
 * the door, where they are the first thing seen on walking in. That is the
 * arrangement the owner laid out by hand in the game's own editor and asked
 * for; `PickupLane` in objects/pickupTypes.ts is what routes each item to its
 * column.
 *
 * The lower-case slots are overflow, reached only once a lane's visible column
 * is full or a cover pillar has buried part of it, so a normal drop table looks
 * exactly like the diagram's capitals and nothing else.
 *
 * Slots are ordered, and boss/wavePickups.ts walks one cursor per lane across
 * *every* tier rather than restarting each tier, so the 50% drops and the
 * boss-death drops sit next to each other in the same column instead of
 * stacking on one tile.
 *
 * Pure geometry — no context, no RNG, no map. Whether a slot is actually free
 * floor is wavePickups.ts's problem: it holds the reachability mask and skips
 * to the lane's next slot when a cover pillar sits on one.
 */

/**
 * How many rows deep each lane runs.
 *
 * Every lane is two columns wide, so this is 20 slots each for health, mana and
 * the upgrades — far past any sane tier table. The width is not decoration:
 * cover pillars are placed before this rig runs and DO land on the pad (seed
 * 777 puts one squarely in the mana lane), so a lane needs slack to route
 * around a buried tile rather than running out and stacking. The second column
 * is only ever reached once the first is used up or blocked, so the ordinary
 * case still reads as the single clean column of the reference layout.
 *
 * Ten rows reaches `padY - 10`, inside even a minimum-height (42-tile) arena.
 * A lane that somehow exhausts both columns wraps to its first slot and
 * stacks, which is legal: two items on one tile are both pickable.
