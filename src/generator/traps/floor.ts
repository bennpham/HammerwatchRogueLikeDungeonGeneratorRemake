/**
 * Traps on an ordinary dungeon floor — projectile spewers lining room walls.
 *
 * The arena's rig (boss/traps.ts) one level up: a floor may carry any number of
 * trap rows, each naming a projectile, the direction it fires, how wide it
 * fans, how often it shoots and how many spewers to place. They share the
 * placement primitives (traps/slots.ts) and every playtested constant in them.
 *
 * Three things are deliberately NOT shared, because a floor is not an arena:
 *
 *   - **No tiers, no triggers.** An arena has health thresholds to switch
 *     hazard sets between; a floor has nothing to switch on, so every spewer
 *     ships `enabled: True` and is live from load, exactly as buffs/field.ts's
 *     aura is. A floor's rig is N spewer nodes and nothing else — no
 *     GlobalEventTrigger, no ToggleElement.
 *   - **`count` is counted over the FLOOR.** A tier's row places `count`
 *     spewers along one arena wall. A floor's row places `count` spewers spread
 *     over every eligible room's wall of that direction, because a floor's unit
 *     of design is the floor, not the room — a dungeon master asking for six
 *     arrow traps wants six, not six per room on a floor whose room count is
 *     itself a roll.
 *   - **The pool is per direction, not per wall.** One flat pool for the whole
 *     floor, built by walking `level.rooms` in index order. Bigger rooms
 *     contribute more slots and so attract proportionally more traps, which is
 *     the distribution you want: a broom cupboard should not get the same
 *     hazard as a hall.
 *
 * ## Where a spewer goes
 *
 * On the innermost interior floor tile of the room wall it fires *away* from —
 * `up` along the room's south wall shooting north, `down` along its north wall,
 * `left` along its east wall, `right` along its west. `Room.contains` is
 * inclusive, so a room's interior is [r.x, r.x + r.width] x [r.y, r.y +
 * r.height] and its wall band is the ring outside that.
 *
 * Both corrections the arena learned in playtest apply unchanged, re-anchored
 * on the room rather than the arena:
 *
 *   - the emitted position is the tile CENTRE (`TILE_CENTRE`), never the
 *     integer corner, which on a minimum edge lies on the band boundary and
 *     eats the projectile as it spawns;
 *   - the north wall's row is `r.y + overhangRows(theme)`, not `r.y`: on the
 *     lettered themes the wall art hangs two tiles down over the floor in front
 *     of it. This is the same `r.y + 2` that `spawnKey`, `grantLockLoot` and
 *     `map/buttonSeal.ts` already treat as the top of a room's usable interior;
 *     asking the theme is strictly better, because the flat-anchored themes
 *     (h, every bonus<n>) bury nothing and can use the row.
 *
 * Every slot is then checked over a window widened by TRAP_WALL_MARGIN on both
 * sides — the arena's `overlaps` trick, because a spewer two tiles from a
 * doorway still fires down it:
 *
 *   - Its own tile must be this room's floor: not a wall, not `wallSet` (a
 *     stair prefab paints its own walls), and `regionMap` must name this room.
 *   - **The band tile behind it must be solid wall.** This is what rejects
 *     passage mouths, and it is one grid read rather than a walk over
 *     `room.passages`. It has to be the band and not `regionMap`, because
 *     `buildTileArray` fills the region map room-first and a passage's last
 *     cells inside the room it arrives at read as the room.
 *   - It must be clear of every ObjectSet's footprint, `contains` and
 *     `containsWall` both — the stairs, the shop, the orb and the two portals.
 *
 * And three room types are skipped whole:
 *
 *   - `Entrance`, because the party materialises there with no warning. The
 *     arena excludes its entrance strip for exactly this reason, and a floor is
 *     entered once, blind.
 *   - `Shop`, because the stall and the browsing party are a fixed target that
 *     cannot dodge.
 *   - `sealed`, the button-gated victory room: one corridor deep, holding the
 *     campaign's last prefab, its geometry already fully spent on the seal.
 *
 * A `locked` vault is deliberately NOT skipped. A trapped reward room is the
 * point of a trapped reward room, and a spewer never blocks a door.
 *
 * ## RNG
 *
 * One `ctx.trapRand.iRand` per placed spewer, and nothing else. Three rules
 * follow, all load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. **It returns before touching the stream** when the floor carries no usable
 *    row (generator invariant 2), so every existing seed stays byte-identical.
 * 2. **`trapRand` is its own stream** (`seed + 3`). Traps are therefore purely
 *    additive: arming any floor leaves every floor's rooms, walls, doodads,
 *    actors, items and pre-existing ids identical. The one thing the stream
 *    carries between floors is its own draws — arming floor 0 moves floor 1's
 *    TRAP POSITIONS and nothing else about floor 1.
 * 3. **`index.ts` calls it after the retry loop has ACCEPTED a floor**, never
 *    from inside the `Level` constructor. The loop builds up to
 *    MAX_LEVEL_ATTEMPTS candidates and `ctx.clearLevel()`s the rejects, but
 *    nothing can rewind a `Rand`: a rig drawing in the constructor would burn
 *    draws on discarded candidates, making a floor's traps depend on how many
 *    times reachability happened to reject it. Drawing only after acceptance
 *    makes the draw count a function of the trap config alone.
 *
 * Draw order is fixed and total: rows in list order, copies 0..count-1, one
 * draw each. A row that can place nothing draws nothing.
 *
 * Script nodes carry no collision, so nothing here affects map/reachability.ts
 * or map/sealCheck.ts — which is what makes it safe to run after both have
 * already passed on this floor.
