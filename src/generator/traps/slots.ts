 * Shared spewer primitives — the parts of trap placement that are the same

 *
 * All of this was `boss/traps.ts`'s, and every constant in it was paid for by a
 * playtest; the provenance comments are kept verbatim because they are the
 * reason the numbers are what they are. What stayed behind in `boss/traps.ts`
 * is the arena's own geometry (its four walls, its entrance strip, its alcove
 * mouth); what moved here is everything a room wall needs too.
 *
 * The one deliberate change is `takeSlot`, which now takes a `Rand` rather than
 * a `GenerationContext`: the arena passes `ctx.bossRand` and the floor rig
 * passes `ctx.trapRand`. Passing `ctx.bossRand` makes exactly the draw the
 * arena always made, so the extraction moves no seed — `tests/bossTraps.test.ts`
 * passing untouched is the proof.
