 * rig uses (`map/buttonSeal.ts`'s `sealRoomWall`), but with no button: the key
 * is the boss's death.
 *
 *   GlobalEventTrigger("Boss Died") -> DestroyObject -> the wall pieces
 *
 * Which is, line for line, what `boss/arena.ts` wires to its alcove seals. The
 * announce line is this rig's own, because a floor has no other signal that
 * something across the map just opened.
 *
 * A floor that is also LOCKED (issue #69) needs the boss and its button both:
 * the death trigger and the button's AreaTrigger each count down one shared
 * Variable, and the wall comes down off that countdown instead.
 *
 * Draws no random values.
