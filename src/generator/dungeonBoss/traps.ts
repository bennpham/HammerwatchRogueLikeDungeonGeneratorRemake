/**
 * Wall traps that switch with the boss's health, on a dungeon floor.
 *
 * The issue states the difference exactly: a floor's ordinary traps
 * (`traps/floor.ts`) are always on, and these are the same spewers in the same
 * places but switchable. So this is `traps/floor.ts`'s PLACEMENT welded to
 * `boss/traps.ts`'s per-tier WIRING:
 *
 *   ProjectileSpewer × count, on room walls    (tier 0 live, later tiers disabled)
 *
 *   GlobalEventTrigger(TIER_EVENT_NAMES[N - 1])
 *        ├─ ToggleElement{state: 1} per previous carrying tier's spewer  (off)
 *        └─ ToggleElement{state: 0} per own spewer                      (on)
 *
 * Tiers REPLACE one another, as they do in the arena: the hazard changes with
 * the phase instead of accumulating into an uncrossable crossfire. Tier 0
 * arrives live with no trigger at all, because nothing exists to switch it on.
 * "Previous" is the nearest EARLIER tier that actually carries a trap, not
 * `tier - 1` — a floor trapping only 100% and 25% needs the 25% trigger to
 * clear the 100% set, and there is no tier-2 set to name.
 *
 * Pools are per direction and carried across every tier, so two tiers cannot
 * crowd one tile. Draws one `ctx.floorBossRand` value per placed spewer, and
 * must return before touching the stream when no tier carries a trap.
