/**
 * A boss standing on an ordinary dungeon floor (issue #61) — the floor keeps
 * every one of its standard controls and gains a boss, a sealed way out, and
 * the same health-tier rigs the arena runs.
 *
 * Why this is a thinner module than `survival/`. Survival's problem was that
 * the engine fires `Boss 75% / 50% / 25% / Died` ONLY for an actor in the
 * `actors/boss_*` folders, so an arena with no boss had to re-key every rig to
 * a clock. A dungeon floor WITH a boss actor gets those events for free, so
 * `boss/invulnerability.ts` and `boss/checkpoints.ts` are called here verbatim
 * and the tier wiring of `boss/waves.ts` and `boss/traps.ts` is reused as-is.
 * What is genuinely new is PLACEMENT — an arena is one open rectangle and a
 * floor is a graph of rooms — which is what `placement.ts` supplies.
 *
 * Fixed build order. Ids are handed out in call order, so reordering these
 * moves every node after the change:
 *
 *   1. boss actor      one draw: which boss
 *   2. waves           spawn points across the floor   <- draws
 *   3. buffs           one whole-floor field per tier
 *   4. traps           per-tier spewers on room walls  <- draws
 *   5. invulnerability windows on the boss actor
 *   6. checkpoints     respawn / save-game milestones
 *   7. opener          Boss Died -> DestroyObject on the seals
 *   8. pickups         per-tier item drops across the floor <- draws
 *
 * Every step from 2 on returns before allocating an id when its own config is
 * empty, which is what keeps one from moving another's ids. Steps 1, 2, 4 and
 * 8 are the only ones that draw, and they draw only from `ctx.floorBossRand`.
 * Pickups come last on purpose: they were added after the rest, and running
 * last is what lets turning them on move nothing already on the floor.
