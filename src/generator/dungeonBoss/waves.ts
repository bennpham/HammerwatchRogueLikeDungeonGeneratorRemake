/**
 * The boss's spawn tiers on a dungeon floor — `boss/waves.ts`'s anchors path
 * with the nine arena anchors swapped for points scattered across the floor.
 *
 * That swap is the whole module. In the arena rig the anchor list is only ever
 * read as (a) a list of positions to construct `SpawnObject` nodes at and
 * (b) a round-robin divisor; nothing else in the chain knows what an arena is.
 * So the trigger, the interval grouping, the `state: 0` toggle polarity, the
 * `-1` endless branch, `splitRoundRobin` and `scaledMax` all carry over
 * untouched, and only the points differ:
 *
 *   tier 0        GlobalEventTrigger("LevelLoaded")
 *   tier N        GlobalEventTrigger(TIER_EVENT_NAMES[N - 1])
 *        └─ ToggleElement{state: 0} ─> arms TimerTrigger(intervalMs)
 *                                          └─ SpawnObject × spawn points
 *
 * Tier 0 is the one place the two genuinely differ. An arena fires it from an
 * `AreaTrigger` over the entrance mouth, because the party walks into an arena
 * through one door; a dungeon floor has no such choke point — the party arrives
 * on the stairs and the boss may be anywhere — so tier 0 arms on `LevelLoaded`
 * instead. [UNVERIFIED], same as everywhere else that event is used.
 *
 * Points come from `placement.ts`'s floor-wide interior pool, which means a
 * tier's monsters arrive from every eligible room rather than from one place.
 * That is the issue's own wording — "like how the current dungeon place
 * monsters in areas where you can place monster in a dungeon" — and it makes
 * the fight pull the party around the floor instead of being a single arena
 * brawl.
 *
 * Draws one value per spawn point taken, from `ctx.floorBossRand`.
