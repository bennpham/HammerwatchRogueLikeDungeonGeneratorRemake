 * `16 48` frame with a 40px collision polygon, and doodad.ts emits it at

 * `T + 2` — the two floor rows under any wall mass are dead space the player
 * cannot stand in. [VERIFIED] in game; the boss arena already compensates for
 * the same fact (see boss/arena.ts's alcove geometry).
 *
 * Nothing in the tilemap records this, which is how a floor could ship with a
 * corridor that looks open in the preview and in `data-t` while being sealed
 * in game: the corridor's only shared row with the room it reaches sat inside
 * the overhang of the wall above it.
