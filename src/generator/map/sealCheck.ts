/**
 * Can the party reach the orb without opening the gate that guards it?
 *
 * This is the floor's actual promise, and until now nothing checked it.
 * `exitReachable` deliberately fills *through* the seal — the seal is doodads,
 * not tiles, and what that check proves is that the *button* is reachable — so
 * four separate ways of walking around the gate shipped before anyone noticed,
 * each found by playing the game. They fell into two families:
 *
 *  1. The barrier was in the wrong place, or fenced the wrong edge of the right
 *     tile, so the corridor was not actually closed.
 *  2. The gated room was simply open on another side. `buildTileArray` marks a
 *     tile floor if *any* room or passage contains it, so two regions that merely
 *     touch merge with no wall band between them — and the gate, which is built
 *     from the room's one registered passage, never sees the second way in.
 *
 * No amount of care in `buttonSeal.ts` can fix family 2, so this asks the
 * question directly instead: block the gate, walk from the entrance, and reject
 * the floor if the orb is still reachable. Draws no random values; a floor that
 * fails re-rolls like any other invalid one.
