/**
 * Timer mode: the per-floor timed hazard.
 *
 * A floor with its timer on gives the party a countdown. When it runs out, a
 * DangerArea covering the whole map switches on and starts ticking `damage`
 * every `freqMs` milliseconds. A **negative** damage heals instead, so the same
 * rig covers "the floor turns hostile" and "the floor starts healing you".
 *
 * The rig, ported from the hand-authored test_damage_player_timer.xml:
 *
 *   RectangleShape(types: 1, whole map)          // players only, not monsters
 *   DangerArea{enabled: False, damage, freq, buff: ""} -> that shape
 *   GlobalEventTrigger("LevelLoaded")
 *        ├─ delay 0                AnnounceText "3:00"
 *        ├─ delay 1000             AnnounceText "2:59"
 *        ├─ ...                    (one node per second)
 *        ├─ delay seconds*1000     AnnounceText "0:00"
 *        └─ delay seconds*1000     ToggleElement{state: 0} -> the DangerArea
 *
 * `state: 0` ENABLES the target — the same inverted polarity NodeToggleElement
 * documents, re-confirmed against the shipped prefabs/trap_fire_floor.xml, where
 * area-enter sends state 0 and area-exit sends state 1.
 *
 * Like waves.ts and invulnerability.ts this module draws **no** random values
 * from any stream and writes no XML directly — the nodes self-register on
 * `ctx.scriptNodes` and Level.getXML() drains them. It runs after the floor is
 * fully built, so every dungeon id is already allocated and the rig only appends
 * ids: a seed's dungeon is untouched whether the timer is on or off.
