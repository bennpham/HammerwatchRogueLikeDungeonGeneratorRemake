/**
 * Timed spawn rows — the survival arena's answer to `boss/waves.ts`'s five
 * health tiers.
 *
 * A boss arena's waves are keyed to the boss losing health. A survival arena
 * has no boss, so its waves are keyed to the clock instead, and the shape that
 * falls out is simpler: a flat list of rows, each naming one monster, how many
 * of it, when the row starts, and how fast it trickles.
 *
 *   GlobalEventTrigger("LevelLoaded")
 *        ├─ delay atSeconds*1000 ─> ToggleElement{state: 0}
 *        │                               └─ arms TimerTrigger(intervalMs)
 *        │                                       └─ SpawnObject × 9 anchors
 *        └─ delay   seconds*1000 ─> ToggleElement{state: 1}   (endless rows only)
 *                                        └─ stops that same timer
 *
 * That inner half — timer, toggle, and the count split round-robin over the
 * nine anchors — is `boss/waves.ts:250-281` unchanged, down to reusing its
 * `splitRoundRobin` and its `scaledMax`. Only the trigger on the front differs,
 * and the stop on the back, which a boss tier has no use for.
 *
 * Two things a row is NOT:
 *
 * 1. **Not a tier.** "50 bats at the start and 200 more two minutes in" is two
 *    rows naming the same monster. Neither replaces the other and neither
 *    cancels the other — they are two independent timers, and by 2:00 both are
 *    running. Boss tiers behave the same way (nothing ever disables a wave
 *    timer), so this is continuity rather than a new rule.
 * 2. **Not scattered.** Issue #61 removes scattered spawns from Survival
 *    outright, which is why this module never asks for spawn points and
 *    `arena.ts` hands `placeSpawnPoints` an empty request list in survival
 *    mode — so the arena makes no `ctx.bossRand` draw there at all.
 *
 * **Endless rows.** `count: -1` is the same sentinel a boss tier's `monsterMax`
 * uses: every anchor gets one unbounded `SpawnObject` (`trigger-times` left at
 * its -1 default) and the monster keeps coming. `scaledMax` is what keeps it
 * from being scaled by the arena's `monsterMultiplier` — a sentinel is not a
 * quantity — and reusing it rather than re-deriving the rule is what stops the
 * two rigs drifting on that.
 *
 * Where survival differs from a boss tier is the END. A boss fight is
 * unbounded, so nothing ever disables a wave timer; a survival round finishes
 * at a known second, and an endless row left running past it keeps filling the
 * arena behind the party as they walk out — at a 500 ms interval across nine
 * anchors that is ~18 actors a second, for as long as anyone lingers, which is
 * the 2026-08-27 flood that made the arena unplayable, just spread over time.
 * So an endless row gets a `ToggleElement{state: 1}` on the same clock tick
 * that opens the alcove. Finite rows need nothing: they self-limit through
 * `trigger-times`.
 *
 * Draws no random values from any stream.
