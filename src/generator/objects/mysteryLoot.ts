/**
 * The items a mystery button (issue #67) can spawn — chests, coins and
 * diamonds, then every wave pickup.
 *
 * Kept apart from PICKUP_DEFS on purpose. That roster is the arena's, and each
 * of its entries carries a drop-pad `lane` (boss/pickupPad.ts); a chest has no
 * lane there, and adding one to PICKUP_DEFS would offer it on every wave
 * tier's picker too. A mystery button has no pad — its loot lands on the tiles
 * nearest the plate — so here the lane is simply dropped.
 *
 * Verification status (see hammerwatch-modding/references/):
 *   every PICKUP_DEFS entry — as documented in objects/pickupTypes.ts
 *   [VERIFIED]   chest_red via SpawnObject — the owner's sample and the
 *                mystery-button playtest, 2026-09-26
 *   [UNVERIFIED] chest_wood / chest_blue / chest_green via SpawnObject — same
 *                asset family, already placed as items by objects/item.ts
 *   [VERIFIED]   valuable_1..9 via SpawnObject — owner playtest 2026-09-26.
 *                Gold amounts read from assetsExtract/items/valuable_*.xml
 *                (`behavior="money"`, `amount`); the metal is the sprite's
 *                colour on items.png (see DISCOVERY-LOG 2026-09-26)
 *   [VERIFIED]   valuable_diamond_red — the lobbies' 500-gold diamond
 *   [UNVERIFIED] valuable_diamond_small / _small_red / valuable_diamond via
 *                SpawnObject — amounts read from their asset files
