/**
 * The two committed shop-room templates a lobby slot can be built from.
 *
 * Before issue #48 these were two separate, near-identical features: the
 * campaign's single starting "lobby" (`lobby/template.ts`) and a shop room
 * welded to the front of every boss fight ("bossprep",
 * `../bossprep/template.ts`). A name-normalised diff of their old `build.ts`
 * files showed every executable line identical apart from an import path and
 * a default argument — only the committed template strings and their
 * coordinate tables actually differ. This file collapses the two into one
 * `LobbyPresetDef` per template, both edited by the same `buildLobby()`.
 *
 * `../bossprep/template.ts` stays where it is — it is 116 KB of data written by
 * `scripts/import-bossprep-assets.mjs`, and moving it would bury the real diff
 * of this change in a file rename. This module is simply another importer of
 * it, the way `lobby/build.ts` already imports `./template.ts`.
