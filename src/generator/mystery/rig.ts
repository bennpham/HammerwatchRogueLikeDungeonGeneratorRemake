/**
 * Mystery buttons (issue #67) — floor plates hidden around a finished dungeon
 * floor. Stepping on one presses it for good and fires whatever its pool entry
 * carries, all at once: loot beside the plate, monsters a few tiles out, the
 * room's walls turning into spewers, an announcement — or nothing but the
 * click, which is a legitimate outcome and the point of the gamble.
 *
 * Transcribed from the owner's hand-built `test_mystery_button_simple.xml`:
 *
 *   trigger_button_floor doodad (need-sync)
 *   RectangleShape w1 h1 over it  <- AreaTrigger (one shot)
 *     -> PlaySound button_hatch
 *     -> ChangeDoodadState `pressed` on the plate
 *     -> AnnounceText                     (only when the button has text)
 *     -> SpawnObject per loot copy        (trigger-times 1 each)
 *     -> SpawnObject per monster copy     (trigger-times 1 each)
 *     -> ToggleElement{state 0} per spewer (the spewers ship disabled)
 *     -> ToggleElement{state 1} per spewer, delayed  (only with trapSeconds)
 *
 * Enhanced lock buttons (built on issue #69's locked floors) reuse the same
 * payload — see `emitPayload` — on a lock button's OWN trigger instead of a
 * fresh plate: the lock button already has its own PlaySound and press, so
 * only the payload nodes (announce, loot, monsters, spewers, delayed
 * switch-off) are new there.
 *
 * ## RNG
 *
 * Everything that draws draws from `ctx.mysteryRand` alone, after the floor
 * was accepted and after every other per-floor rig — the same terms as
 * `traps/floor.ts`, for the same reason: the retry loop discards candidates
 * and nothing can rewind a Rand. The fixed order per floor:
 *
 *   Phase A: for each ordinary mystery plate in turn, one `iRand` for its tile
 *            and one for which pool button it is.
 *   Phase B: for each plate in the same order, one `iRand` per spewer its
 *            traps place (`emitPayload`).
 *   Phase C: for each ENHANCED lock button in turn (the first `count` entries
 *            of `level.lockButtons`, in the order they were placed), one
 *            `iRand` for which pool button it is.
 *   Phase D: for each enhanced lock button in the same order, one `iRand` per
 *            spewer its traps place (`emitPayload` again).
 *
 * Phases C and D run strictly after A and B, so enabling the enhancement
 * never moves this floor's own plates — only a later floor's mysteryRand
 * draws. A plate the tile pool cannot place draws nothing, an enhanced button
 * whose room has no wall slots left places no spewer, and a floor with
 * neither ordinary plates nor lock enhancements configured returns before
 * touching the stream or allocating an id.
