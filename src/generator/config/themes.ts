/**
 * A bonus theme.
 *
 * Two things differ from the lettered themes, both read out of the game's asset
 * XML rather than guessed:
 *
 * 1. **Anchoring.** The lettered wall art is anchored low — `a_h_8.xml` declares
 *    `<origin>0 32</origin>` and `a_v_8.xml` `<origin>0 16</origin>`, which is
 *    exactly why `DoodadType` carries `yOffset` 2 and 1 for them (offset =
 *    origin_y / 16). Every piece in every bonus folder is anchored at `0 0`
 *    instead, so it needs `yOffset: 0`. Getting this wrong displaces the
 *    collision polygon along with the art, and the player walks through walls.
 * 2. **Missing pieces.** The bonus folders ship no `_exit_h_dn` / `_exit_h_up`
 *    stair frames; the game provides one shared pair. `ExitUp` is the
 *    level-start alcove, `ExitDn` the one carrying the level-exit node (see
 *    ObjectSet). There is no `color_theme_bonus<n>_16` either, so `Cover` — a
 *    pure character-occlusion overlay with no collider — borrows a lettered one.

/**
 * Theme "h" — the desert *outdoors* set, where "i" is desert indoors.
 *
 * It is a cliff/ledge set rather than a wall set, so it deviates from the
 * lettered themes in four ways, all read out of the supplied asset XML:
 *
 * 1. **Its colliders are edge fences, not solid tiles.** This is the fact the
 *    rest of the theme hangs off, and the one that has bitten twice. Each piece
 *    barricades a single edge of its tile — `h_h_8_dn` the top (y -0.13..0.38),
 *    `h_v_8_l` the right (x 0.63..1.13), `h_v_8_r` the left — and a room is
 *    sealed because those fences join into a closed loop around its wall band,
 *    not because the band is solid. The player can stand *inside* a boundary
 *    tile; that is by design. Two consequences: swapping one piece for another
 *    is only safe when the replacement fences the *same* edge, and wherever two
 *    perpendicular fences meet, something must close the joint (see 4).
 * 2. **Anchoring.** Every piece is `<origin>0 0</origin>`, like the bonus art and
 *    unlike the lettered art, so the 16x16 pieces take `yOffset: 0`. That is
 *    *not* a blanket rule: the folder's 16x32 pieces hold their polygon in the
 *    lower half and need `yOffset: -1` — `h_h_8_up`, both *up* corners, and both
 *    `h_h_cap_up_*`. Read the `<frame>` height and the polygon's y range before
 *    assuming a piece is flat; a 16x32 left at 0 fences the tile *below* the
 *    wall, which is a hole the player walks out of the level through.
 * 3. **Facing instead of junctions.** It ships no tees or cross, but it does ship
 *    a cliff face per direction (`h_h_8_dn`/`h_h_8_up`, `h_v_8_l`/`h_v_8_r`), and
 *    a `T*` pattern is precisely "wall mass with the opening on one side". So the
 *    tees map onto the faces by direction rather than borrowing junction art —
 *    which matters, because the tees are ~84% of a level's wall doodads.
 * 4. **Missing pieces.** No `x_x` and no `v_cap_*`. These take cliff faces too,
 *    so theme h borrows nothing from theme i and never mixes indoor stone into
 *    an outdoor level — but `CrossWall` is the corner joint from 1 and must be
 *    given a piece that covers the *whole* tile, not a fence. An absent wall
 *    doodad is an absent collider, so dropping any of them is not an option.
 *    `Cover` is the exception — see `omitCover`, which this theme sets.
