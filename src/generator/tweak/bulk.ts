 *    the same `player.*` keys the per-field form writes, so parameters.txt,
 *    validation and emission are unchanged. A knob's displayed value is
 *    *derived* back out of the overrides, exactly as `deriveCostCurve` does for
 *    a single ladder.
 * 2. **Factors are relative to stock, not to the current value.** That makes
 *    them idempotent — `×2` always means "stock doubled", never "double again" —
 *    and it is what lets the derive step recover the factor at all. A factor of
 *    exactly 1 therefore writes nothing, which keeps the "no player edits ⇒ no
 *    tweak/ folder" invariant intact.
 *
 * Pure and RNG-free, like the rest of tweak/.
