            To combine them, import <strong>parameters.txt</strong> (or load a campaign preset) <em>first</em>, then
            import <strong>playersettings.txt</strong> on top. The other way round, the campaign would overwrite
            your player build.
          </p>

          <h3>Load preset…</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Campaign presets</strong> are ready-made campaigns and replace every tab, like importing a
              parameters.txt.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Player presets</strong> replace only the Player tab, like importing a playersettings.txt.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Reset and Reset all</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Reset</strong> resets only the left-panel tab you are looking at, which is why its label
              changes (Reset lobbies, Reset player tweaks, …). The other tabs are left alone.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reset all</strong> (red) puts every tab back to the defaults. It asks first, and the toast
              afterwards has an <strong>Undo</strong>. Your Hammerwatch folder is kept.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>AI assistant (chat icon)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Describe a campaign in plain words (“4 icy floors, a boss on the last one, lots of traps”) and it
              proposes the settings.
            </li>
            <li>
              Strictly opt-in: nothing is sent anywhere until you choose a provider and send a message. Ollama runs
              locally; the others send your prompt and current settings to that provider.
            </li>
            <li>
              Its answer is checked like an imported parameters.txt. You see what would change before you press{' '}
              <strong>Apply</strong>, and the toast afterwards has an <strong>Undo</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              To remove the icon, tick <em>Hide the chat icon</em> in its setup screen; <em>Show the AI preset
              assistant icon</em> in the bottom panel brings it back.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Starting defaults</h3>
          <p>
            A parameters.txt placed in the app’s user-data folder is loaded as the starting settings each time the
            app opens.
